# Streaming Service Roadmap

## Current State

The streaming service currently provides basic Server-Sent Events (SSE) functionality for real-time chat responses. It includes core SSE protocol implementation with status updates, final results, and error handling.

## Enhancement Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Reliability (Q3 2025)

**Files to create:**

```
streaming/
├── index.ts                 # Main service exports
├── types.ts                # Streaming-specific interfaces
├── protocol/
│   ├── sse-formatter.ts    # SSE protocol formatting
│   └── event-builder.ts    # Event construction utilities
└── connection/
    ├── manager.ts          # Connection lifecycle
    └── registry.ts         # Active connection tracking
```

  preferences: {
    updateFrequency: "realtime" | "batched";
    responseFormat: "detailed" | "concise";
    includeMetadata: boolean;
  };
  rateLimits: {
    maxConcurrentStreams: number;
    requestsPerMinute: number;
  };
}
```

#### 3.2 Rate Limiting & Resource Management
