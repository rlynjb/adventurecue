This document contains proven prompt templates for successfully building features in complex applications. These templates follow incremental, safe development with clear boundaries and stopping points.

## Feature Development Workflow

Break down any feature by following these 5 sequential steps:

### 1. Database Design, Schema, and Migration

#### Basic Version:

```
build a simple [FEATURE_NAME] for this app as if junior trainee developer is building it. just include the essentials or foundation but it can be extended in future.
dont build the entire thing in a single chat question. start with setting up database first. and then stop from there.
there is already existing tables and data set. create a migration file that can only add new tables. avoid dropping tables and deleting data!
```

#### Optimized Version (Recommended):

```
I want to implement a [FEATURE_NAME] feature.

I'm adding a basic [FEATURE_NAME] feature to my [APPLICATION_TYPE] application.

Here's the context:
- I'm using TypeScript
- My backend is deployed on [DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM]
- [DATABASE_TYPE] is the database
- [ORM_NAME] is used for schema and queries
- There are already existing tables and datasets ‚Äî do NOT modify or drop them
- Assume a junior developer is implementing this feature, so keep it minimal, clean, and extensible
- Build the foundation only ‚Äî focus **just on the database setup for now**

Please:
- Create a new migration file for [ORM_NAME]
- Only **add** new tables needed for [FEATURE_REQUIREMENTS]
- Avoid destructive changes (no drops, no deletes, no renames)
- Use [PRIMARY_KEY_TYPE] for primary keys
- Include sensible columns: [REQUIRED_COLUMNS]
- Follow best practices for future extensibility

Stop after writing the migration. Don't build any endpoints or logic yet.
```

### 2. Define Essential Service Features, Utilities, and Types

#### Basic Version:

```
I would like to expand this [SERVICE_NAME] service to be implemented on the [TARGET_SERVICE] service.
Refer to docs/[DATABASE_DOC].md to see what [FEATURE] tables and fields have already been migrated.
and refer to docs/services/[TARGET_SERVICE].md of the architecture, layers, and core components that are already in place.
Keep it minimal and essential.
Stick to just [CORE_FUNCTIONALITY] and don't add anything extra.
I will expand later.
```

#### Optimized Version (Recommended):

```
I would like to expand the [SERVICE_NAME] service to be implemented into the existing [TARGET_SERVICE] service.

üìö References:
- See `docs/[DATABASE_DOC].md` for the [FEATURE] tables and fields that have already been migrated.
- See `docs/services/[TARGET_SERVICE].md` for the service architecture, layer structure, and existing core components.

üéØ Goal:
Implement minimal [FEATURE] support by adding logic to [CORE_FUNCTIONALITY] within the [TARGET_SERVICE] flow.

‚úÖ Constraints:
- Stick to just [CORE_FUNCTIONALITY]
- No additional features (e.g. [ADVANCED_FEATURE_1], [ADVANCED_FEATURE_2], [ADVANCED_FEATURE_3])
- Do not modify existing tables or services unless explicitly required
- Use existing architectural patterns and abstractions in the [TARGET_SERVICE] service
- Include proper error handling for database operations and edge cases
- Add input validation where data enters the service
- Assume this is a foundational step that will be expanded later

Keep the implementation clean, minimal, and extensible.
```

**Deploy and test to see if the main functionality is still working** (add tracing, logging, debugging later)

#### Testing Prompt (Optional but Recommended):

```
Create basic tests for the [SERVICE_NAME] service to ensure it works correctly.

üß™ Testing Requirements:
- Write simple unit tests for core [SERVICE_NAME] functions
- Test database operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Verify error handling and edge cases
- Use existing testing patterns in the codebase
- Keep tests minimal but comprehensive

üéØ Focus:
- Test the happy path and one error scenario per function
- Ensure database operations don't affect existing data
- Verify type safety and schema compliance

Stop after creating basic tests. Integration tests can be added later.
```

### 3. Service Integration - Where Can This Service Be Used?

#### Basic Version:

```
Expand this service by integrating the new [SERVICE_NAME]
```

#### Optimized Version (Recommended):

```
Expand the application by integrating the new `[SERVICE_NAME]` into existing components.

üéØ Goal:
- Connect `[SERVICE_NAME]` to the relevant parts of the system where it logically fits
- Follow the architectural conventions used in the app
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between layers (e.g., API handler, service logic, data access)

üìö Reference:
- Review `docs/services/[SERVICE_NAME].md` for the service architecture and usage
- Identify touchpoints in other services (e.g., [RELATED_SERVICE_1], [RELATED_SERVICE_2], [RELATED_SERVICE_3]) that should consume or communicate with `[SERVICE_NAME]`

‚úÖ Requirements:
- Use existing interfaces or abstractions where applicable
- Avoid modifying unrelated components
- Ensure the integration is minimal, testable, and extensible
- Include basic logging or debug outputs where helpful

üîß Deliverables:
- Updated code where `[SERVICE_NAME]` is invoked or referenced
- Notes or inline comments explaining integration decisions
- Optional: Add integration test stubs or usage examples if meaningful
```

### 4. API/Endpoint Implementation (Netlify Functions)

#### Optimized Version (Recommended):

```
Integrate the `[SERVICE_NAME]` into an existing or new [DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM] Function endpoint (`[ENDPOINT_PATH]/[name].ts`) in the application.

üéØ Objective:
- Implement the `[SERVICE_NAME]` logic within the API handler
- Keep the endpoint focused and minimal ‚Äî only handle routing, validation, and passing data to the service

üß± Requirements:
- Use the existing folder structure and architecture conventions (e.g., handler ‚Üí service ‚Üí db)
- Perform input validation at the top of the function (use `zod` or existing schema if available)
- Call the appropriate method(s) from `[SERVICE_NAME]` and return formatted API responses
- Add clear and minimal logging for debugging

üß™ Example Flow:
1. Validate request
2. Extract required params or body
3. Call `[SERVICE_NAME]` method
4. Return a proper response (`200`, `400`, `500` with JSON)

üìö Reference:
- Check `docs/services/[SERVICE_NAME].md` for service details
- Use existing endpoint patterns from other files in `[ENDPOINT_PATH]/`

‚úÖ Constraints:
- Do not hardcode logic inside the API function ‚Äî delegate to the service
- Avoid adding extra responsibilities or unrelated logic

üì¶ Output:
- A working [DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM] Function handler that routes to `[SERVICE_NAME]`
- Clean error handling and a success response format
- Inline comments explaining each step of the integration
- Basic performance considerations (e.g., connection pooling, query optimization)
- Monitoring/logging hooks for debugging in production
```

#### Performance & Monitoring Prompt (Optional):

```
Add basic monitoring and performance optimizations to the [SERVICE_NAME] endpoint.

üîç Monitoring:
- Add request/response logging with timestamps
- Include performance metrics (response time, database query time)
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Use existing logging patterns in the codebase

‚ö° Performance:
- Implement basic caching where appropriate
- Optimize database queries (use indexes, limit results)
- Add request rate limiting if needed
- Consider connection pooling for database operations

Keep optimizations simple and measurable.
```

### 5. Frontend UI Implementation - Consuming the Endpoint

#### API Documentation Prompt:

```
Write a clean and minimal API documentation in markdown format for a [DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM] Function endpoint.
Create an md file in docs/api/[ENDPOINT_NAME].md
The function is located at [ENDPOINT_PATH]/[ENDPOINT_NAME]
Include a table of contents after the main title
Include:
  - endpoint description
  - method & full URL path
  - request headers
  - request body table + example
  - success response
  - error response
  - frontend usage in TypeScript
  - HTTP status codes
  - security notes (if any)
  - related endpoints table
  - Suggest a possible UI 3rd-party library or a basic custom React implementation.
```

#### Security Review Prompt (Recommended):

```
Review the [FEATURE_NAME] implementation for basic security considerations.

üîí Security Checklist:
- Input validation and sanitization at all entry points
- SQL injection prevention (using parameterized queries)
- Authentication/authorization requirements
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Data privacy considerations (PII handling)
- CORS configuration if needed

üéØ Focus:
- Ensure no sensitive data is logged or exposed
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Follow existing security patterns in the codebase
- Document any security assumptions or requirements

Keep security measures practical and aligned with existing patterns.
```

## Development Guidelines

Write all code adhering to these principles:

- **Beginner-friendly**: Make it as accessible as possible for junior developers
- **Architecture alignment**: Tie it to current architecture and tech stack
- **Composable design**: Minimize refactoring later on
- **Documentation reference**: Refer to files in the docs directory for architecture, tech stack, and app information
- **Educational comments**: Include comments as if a junior trainee developer is reading them
- **Essential focus**: Implement only the essentials - keep it simple
- **Rollback ready**: Structure changes so they can be easily reverted if needed
- **Feature flags**: Consider using feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Rollback Strategy Template:

```
If this [FEATURE_NAME] needs to be rolled back:

üîÑ Database Rollback:
- Create a rollback migration file that removes the new tables
- Ensure rollback doesn't affect existing data
- Test rollback process in development first

üì¶ Code Rollback:
- Keep feature code isolated in separate modules/files
- Use feature flags to enable/disable functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
- Document rollback steps for quick recovery
```

---

## Service Documentation Template

### Documentation Generation Prompt:

#### Basic Version:

```
in docs/services, create a file called [SERVICE_NAME] for documentation for [SERVICE_PATH].
- Include a simple flow diagram, make colors darker, and incorporate design patterns.
- Make it concise, focusing on architecture and its layers rather than implementation details.
- Include a section specifying where this service or feature has been integrated.
- The last section will be Usage. Include terminal commands for common use cases, a How-to guide for implementation, and examples.
- Add a table of contents after the main title.
```

#### Optimized Version (Recommended):

```
Create a documentation file at `docs/services/[SERVICE_NAME].md` for the `[SERVICE_PATH]` service in my [APPLICATION_TYPE] application.

üß± Structure:

1. **Title**: `[SERVICE_NAME] Service`
2. **Add a Table of Contents** after the title
3. **Flow Diagram**:
   - Include a simple architecture flow diagram
   - Use darker, accessible color scheme
   - Reflect key design patterns used (e.g., layered, modular, or event-driven)
   - Keep it focused on architecture, not implementation

4. **Architecture Section**:
   - Clearly explain the service's purpose
   - Break down the architectural layers involved (e.g., handler, service logic, database layer)
   - Mention any design pattern applied (repository pattern, service abstraction, etc.)
   - Keep this section concise and high-level

5. **Integration Points**:
   - List where and how this service is integrated into other parts of the app (e.g., [RELATED_SERVICE_1], [RELATED_SERVICE_2])
   - Reference related services or endpoints

6. **Usage Section**:
   - Add terminal commands for common use cases (e.g., run migration, test endpoint)
   - Include a brief "How-to" guide for implementing or extending the feature
   - Provide practical examples (e.g., [EXAMPLE_ACTION_1], [EXAMPLE_ACTION_2])

üìù Keep everything focused and minimal ‚Äî no deep implementation details or internal logic unless essential for usage.
```
